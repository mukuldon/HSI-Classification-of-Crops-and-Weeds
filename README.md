# HSI-Classification-of-Crops-and-Weeds
A 3D CNN-based hyperspectral imaging project for accurate crop and weed classification. It leverages spectral and spatial features from proximal HSI data (400–1000 nm) to enable precise, real-time plant discrimination in agriculture.
The dataset consist of 3 weed image dataset and 3 crop image dataset which are in .npy format and because of github limits i cannot upload it here so you may get it from the following link:

while preprocessing you will need to convert all the image files in .csv format so have a free space upto 300 gb because the csv files are very large and will make up all of your dataset upto 250-300 gb.
